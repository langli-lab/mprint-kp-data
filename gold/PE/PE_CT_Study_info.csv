Five characteristics define which hospitals are selected for inclusion in the NIS: geographic region Northeast, South, Midwest, and West, ownership public, investor-owned, and not-for-profit, location urban or rural, teaching status, and number of inpatient beds, thereby creating a sample that is representative of all U.S. hospitalizations.

Exclusionary criteria were maternal psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, or language difficulties precluding a valid informed consent. Opiate exposure was determined by maternal admission of drug use during pregnancy or by a positive enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique screen for drug metabolites in meconium, confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS; 41, 42). Non-exposure was determined by self-report of no opiate use during pregnancy confirmed by a negative meconium toxicology screen. Exposure to tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana occurred in both the drug-exposed and the comparison group. A NIDA Certificate of Confidentiality was obtained to optimize the validity of maternal report.

An annual sample was created by HCUP using a twostage cluster sampling design. In stage 1, all nonfederal community hospitals e.g., public hospitals and academic medical centers, excluding Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense hospitals from participating. states were stratified by five major hospital characteristics: rural/urban location, number of beds, geographic region, teaching status, and ownership. Then, a systematic random sampling procedure was used to select 20% of hospitals from each unique stratum [16]. In the second stage, all inpatient discharges from hospitals selected during stage 1 were selected for inclusion in the NIS. In 2012, the NIS sampling strategy was modified so that a sample of discharges from all hospitals was instituted. The NIS approximated a 20% systematic sample that was representative of the population of all discharges on critical hospital and patient characteristics [16].

Time to first perception of significant pain (time to first rescue analgesic request – defined as pain score > 3 points) – the time to the first dose of nalbuphine that was administered. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 h after removal of the endotracheal tube – a four-point ordinal scale was utilized (Table 1).
