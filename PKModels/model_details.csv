Model‐Informed Dose Selection for Pediatric Development
A primary objective of the pediatric program for ponatinib is to evaluate its safety and efficacy in combination with multiagent chemotherapy for the treatment of pediatric patients ≥1 year of age with Ph+ ALL. A 30‐mg dose is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in adult patients with Ph+ ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03589326). Accordingly, a model‐informed approach was used to establish pediatric posology to approximately match adult exposures at 30 mg for the design of a pediatric study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04501614). For the purpose of predicting pediatric doses that would match adult exposures at ponatinib 30 mg once daily, the developed model was adapted by removing the previously estimated adult covariate effects and including allometric scaling coefficients of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume parameters, respectively.

 Two studies in patients with aTTP: 1 phase II study (ALX0681‐2.1/10, TITAN, 2010‐019375‐30/NCT01151423) 15 and 1 phase III study (ALX0681‐C301, HERCULES, 2015‐001098‐42/NCT02553317), 16 both performed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of caplacizumab as an adjunct to PE treatment.

Pediatric Population: Simulation Settings and Assumptions
Based on data from the literature, the following parameters in children with aTTP were assumed to be similar to those in adults with aTTP: expression of vWF 34 (baseline vWF:Ag levels) (with a median of 65.6 nM [164 IU/dL], range of 9‐224 nM [22.5‐560 IU/dL], in agreement with Ablynx 15 , 16 ), affinity of caplacizumab to the vWF target, 20 and distribution of patients with aTTP between sexes. 3

With regard to body weight, the simulated pediatric population had a similar body composition as that of US children in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database, 33 and the body weight distribution in the simulated adult population was assumed to be similar to the studied aTTP adult population. 20

In addition, CrCl, as well as the typical clearance, intercompartmental clearance, central volume of distribution, and peripheral volume of distribution values in children were allometrically scaled to adults with an assumed normal renal function for a 70‐kg subject of 120 mL/min.

In addition, the data of phenytoin administration in phase I study was used in the population analysis.

In one of the phase I studies, 12 healthy adult volunteers participated in a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study. Phenytoin sodium 250 mg and fosphenytoin sodium 375 mg were intravenously administered at infusion rates of 8.3 mg/min (administration time, 30 min) and 12.5 mg/min (30 min) respectively. The washout period between the two treatments was set at a minimum of two weeks.

In the second phase I study, 12 healthy adult volunteers participated in a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, dose-escalation study. They were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Each group was intravenously administered a single dose of fosphenytoin sodium 563 mg at a rate of 18.8 mg/min (30 min) or 56.3 mg/min (10 min). After a two-week of washout period, fosphenytoin sodium 750 mg was intravenously administered at a rate of 25 mg/min (30 min) or 75 mg/min (10 min).

In the phase III study, neurosurgical patients were intravenously administered fosphenytoin sodium 15 or 18 mg/kg at an infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/min (15 or 18 min) for the prevention of seizure after brain surgery or head trauma in an open-label manner. The epileptic patients, including those with status epilepticus and acute repetitive seizures, were intravenously administered fosphenytoin sodium 18 or 22.5 mg/kg at an infusion rate of 3 mg/kg/min (6 or 7.5 min for patients weighing <50 kg).

Pharmacokinetic data from five pediatric clinical trialswere used in conducting the population pharma-cokinetic analysis. A brief description of each study ispresented as follows.
Study 1:Pediatric patients between the ages of 4 monthsand 12 years were treated for various infections (uri-nary tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection,and skin and soft tissue infection). Patients receivedciprofloxacin orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg tid for 5 to 7days. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 16patients.8
Study 2:Pediatric patients between the ages of 3 monthsand 5 years were treated for severe sepsis. Patients re-ceived ciprofloxacin by intravenous infusion at a doseof 10 mg/kg bid for 7 to 14 days. Pharmacokinetic datawere obtained from 20 patients.6
Study 3:Pediatric patients between the ages of 6 monthsand 12 years were enrolled in this study for the treat-ment of invasive diarrhea. These patients were treatedwith ciprofloxacin orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg bid(maximum dose of 500 mg bid) and ceftriaxone by in-tramuscular injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg once daily(maximum dose of 1 gram once daily). The duration oftreatment was 3 days. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 86 patients.
Study 4:Pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis between theages of 5 and 17 years were hospitalized for 2 to 3 weeksfor the treatment ofPseudomonas aeruginosaand re-ceived ceftazidime intravenously. During the mainte-nance period, these patients received ciprofloxacin byintravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg bid on Day 1 and received ciprofloxacin orally at a dose of 15 mg/kgbid on Day 2. Further treatment was left to the discre-tion of the investigator. Pharmacokinetic data were ob-tained from 10 patients.9
Study 5:Pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis between theages of 5 and 17 years were treated with ciprofloxacinaccording to the following schedule. Patients receivedciprofloxacin by intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg bid for a minimum of 3 days and receivedciprofloxacin orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg tid for a mini-mum of 3 days.

For this study, PK data from four prior rivipansel studies (three phase I and one phase II) were used. Two phase I studies (unpublished data; Pfizer, Collegeville, PA) evaluated rivipansel in healthy adult volunteers after either a single i.v. dose (study 101; n = 40; doses ranged from 2–40 mg/kg) or after multiple i.v. doses (study 102; n = 32; doses ranged from 2–20 mg/kg every 8 hours and a 40‐mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg every 8 hours) compared to placebo. A third phase I study (study 103; NCT00911495) evaluated rivipansel in adults with SCD after two i.v. doses (n = 15; 20‐mg/kg loading dose followed by a 10‐mg/kg dose after 10 hours) who were not experiencing a VOC.16

In the phase II study (NCT01119833),15 two dose levels of i.v. rivipansel (the first cohort received a 20‐mg/kg loading dose, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days and the second cohort received a 40‐mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days) or placebo were administered to patients with SCD aged 12–60 years who were hospitalized for VOCs (n = 76; 56 adults and 20 children).

Data
A previously published NLME HC PK model based on cortisol plasma data from healthy adults and pediatric patients (Melin et al., 2017; Michelet et al., 2020) served as the starting point for our analysis. The model leveraged data from 1) rich plasma sampling (n = 1,482 total cortisol concentrations) in a phase 1 study (Whitaker et al., 2015) with 30 healthy adult subjects, whose cortisol biosynthesis was suppressed with dexamethasone, and who received a single dose of 0.5 mg up to 20 mg of the pediatric HC formulation Alkindi® (hydrocortisone granules in capsules for opening) (Diurnal Europe B.V., Netherlands).

Additionally, the model leveraged 2) sparse phase 3 cortisol plasma data from 24 pediatric adrenal insufficiency (AI) patients receiving their regular HC-morning dose of Alkindi®, ranging from 1 to 4 mg (Neumann et al., 2018; Melin et al., 2020; Michelet et al., 2020). The pediatric patients were divided into three different cohorts according to their age groups: Young children (n = 12, 2–6 years), infants (n = 6, 28 days-2 years), and term neonates (n = 6: 0–28 days).

To expand this model, simultaneously collected venous total cortisol DBS samples, obtained from the pediatric patients in the phase 3 study, were included. Both total cortisol concentrations in plasma (Whitaker et al., 2015; Melin et al., 2017; Michelet et al., 2020) and in DBS (n = 106 each) were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS).","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-017-0575-8

The final dataset consisted of 1988 rivaroxaban concentration measurements that were valid for PK analysis from 524 pediatric patients across the different study phases (Table 1). Five hundred twelve (97.7%) of these patients participated in one of the EINSTEIN‐Jr studies and contributed 1916 (96.4%) PK samples. Twelve pediatric post‐Fontan patients (2.3%) from the PK part (part A) of the UNIVERSE study contributed 72 PK samples (3.6%). Eighty‐six of the 524 patients (16.4%) were below 2 years of age. The dataset contained PK data after single or multiple rivaroxaban doses and different dose levels and regimens (o.d., b.i.d., or t.i.d.). PK sampling was generally sparse in children. In the single dose EINSTEIN‐Jr phase I studies, the maximum number of PK samples that were collected was five in adolescents and two in children aged 6 months to 2 years. In the EINSTEIN‐Jr multiple dose studies during phases I/II, II, and III, one or two PK samples were taken per child on different study days after a rivaroxaban dose (Table S1).

The analysis was based on bio-analytical data that originated from three clinical studies in children with newly diagnosed ALL.

The phase III trial MC-ASP.5/ALL (EudraCT number 2006-003180-31) compared efficacy and safety of the same two ASNase preparations in a larger number of children with de novo ALL, predominantly studying ASNase trough activities. In this study, 101 children were treated with the native ASNase and 98 with rASNase.

A summary of included studies is given in Table 1 (13,17–19). No pediatric data points were reported as being below the limit of quantification. Unpublished data from a bioequivalence study by Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Leeds, UK) were also included. This was a three-way crossover study comparing diclofenac 50-mg suspension, enteric-coated tablets, and dispersible tablets in healthy adult volunteers. The long absorption lag time seen with enteric-coated tablets meant that this formulation was unsuitable for acute pain, so the enteric-coated tablet data from the bioequivalence study and enteric-coated tablet data from a pediatric study by Romsing et al. (20) were excluded.","https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jibirin1925/75/6/75_6_1445/_article/-char/ja/

Patients
During this PopPK analysis, 3 different data sets were used. Two data sets, 1 from oral and 1 from intravenous busulfan administrations, were used for model development and the third data set from once-daily intravenous busulfan administrations served as external model evaluation data set.
The development data set consisted of 94 children, with a median age of 9.2 years (range 0.4–18.8 years; Table 1A), who received busulfan before bone marrow transplantation for either malignant or nonmalignant conditions. Drug monitoring was used to retrospectively observe the AUC of the plasma concentrations of busulfan. Out of the 94 children, 54 children received oral busulfan every 6 hours. The PK of busulfan in these children were recently described by Schiltmeyer and colleagues (19).
The other 40 children received intravenous busulfan as an infusion. Results from 19 children were recently described by Oechtering and colleagues (35) during a prospective, open, multicenter trial conducted at the University Hospital Münster and additional transplant units. The other 21 children receiving intravenous busulfan were included into the study through routine drug monitoring at the University Hospital Münster. All 94 children received high-dose busulfan in combination with 1 or 2 other chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, thiotepa, etoposide, or fludarabine. To prevent seizures, children were treated with short-term infusions of clonazepam or phenobarbital starting a day before the first busulfan therapy.

The evaluation data set comprised 24 children, with a median age of 2.6 years (range 0.1–18.9 years; Table 1B), who were treated with intravenous busulfan. These children were previously described by Bartelink and colleagues (36).","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00280-003-0631-y

Subjects and trial design
A total of 1510 plasma concentration data were collected from 124 subjects (62 healthy adult subjects, 62 paediatric atopic dermatitis patients) who participated in six clinical trials conducted in Japan (Table 1).
Trial 1 was a phase III open-label trial performed to obtain the safety data in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [9]. In this trial, small numbers of blood samples were collected to obtain pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients. Sixty-two patients were given 10 or 20 mg epinastine as dry syrup once daily for 12 weeks. Dosage was determined according to body weight in this trial. Patients weighing from 14 kg to less than 24 kg and those weighing 24 kg or more were given 10 mg and 20 mg epinastine, respectively. Three blood samples were drawn from the vein of each patient at 2–6 weeks, 6–10 weeks and 10–14 weeks after the first administration. The trials described in the following were all performed in healthy male subjects. Trial 2 was a bioequivalence study of 2.0 g dry syrup (containing 20 mg epinastine) compared with 20 mg tablets, performed in 18 healthy male subjects in a cross-over design. In trial 3, pharmacokinetic data were obtained after single oral administration of 10, 20 or 40 mg epinastine tablets in 9 healthy male subjects [6]. Trial 4 provided pharmacokinetic data after multiple oral administration in healthy male subjects [6]. Twelve subjects were given a 20 mg epinastine tablet once or twice daily for 7 days. Trial 5 was a chronopharmacological trial in which 20 mg epinastine was administered as tablets to seven healthy male subjects [10]. Trial 6 investigated the effect of food.

Data
The data for the development of the population pharmacokinetic two-compartment intravenous model of levetiracetam in adults originated from two Phase I studies in which levetiracetam was given intravenously to healthy subjects. Both study protocols were approved by the ethics committee for the public hospitals of the city of Antwerp (Belgium). The first study (Ramael et al., 2006a), consisted of two parts: part (A) was a randomized, open-label, two-way cross-over bioavailability comparison trial in which a single dose of 1500 mg of levetiracetam was administered either as a 15 min intravenous infusion or as 3 × 500 mg oral tablets; part (B) was a parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial in which placebo or 1500 mg of levetiracetam was administered twice daily as a 15 min intravenous infusion for 4 days in the same subjects. 

The second study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and tolerability study of single ascending doses of levetiracetam 2000, 3000 and 4000 mg administered as 15 min intravenous infusion and 1500, 2000 and 2500 mg as 5 min intravenous infusion (Ramael et al., 2006b).","https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918(06)00115-9/abstract

The data set for this analysis consisted of pooled data from 7 Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG)/International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) protocols: 300, 353, 356, 358, 386, 1056, and 1069.
PACTG 300 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to compare the efficacy of zidovudine and lamivudine dual therapy against didanosine monotherapy in previously untreated HIV-infected children ages 42 days to 15 years. All children enrolled in the dual-therapy arm of the study received 4 mg/kg per dose twice daily (maximum dose of 150 mg/dose) of an innovator (original commercial formulation) lamivudine liquid formulation. Three PK samples were collected at study weeks 0 and 48 in most participants. Samples were obtained at 30 minutes, 1 to 2 hours, and 3 to 4 hours.2

PACTG 356 was a study of HIV-infected infants initiating therapy within the first 2 years of life. Infants were treated with an innovator liquid formulation of lamivudine at 4 mg/kg twice daily in combination with zidovudine and stavudine, abacavir, nevirapine, or nelfinavir. Samples were obtained predose as well as 1 to 3 hours and 4 to 6 hours postdose.20

PACTG 353, 358, and 386 were studies in HIV-exposed term infants receiving postnatal antiretroviral therapy for the first 4 to 6 weeks of life. Infants received an innovator liquid formulation of lamivudine at 2 mg/kg twice daily in combination with zidovudine and stavudine, abacavir, nevirapine, or nelfinavir. The first PK samples were taken in the first to third weeks of life, and the second set of pharmacokinetic samples was taken at 6 weeks of life. Samples were obtained predose as well as 1 to 3 hours and 4 to 6 hours postdose.20

PACTG/IMPAACT 1056 and 1069 were phase I/II studies of HIV-1-infected children in Thailand from 6 months to 13 years of age designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a novel pediatric fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet designed by the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO). P1056 assessed a pediatric FDC chewable tablet composed of stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (7:30:50 mg), whereas P1069 assessed an FDC tablet composed of zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (30:15:28 mg). Children received combination therapy with either the FDC tablets (GPO-VIR) or an equivalent innovator liquid formulation. The lamivudine component was dosed at 4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 150 mg/dose) twice daily. Following intensive PK sampling with 7 plasma samples obtained over the dosing interval, patients were crossed over to the alternate formulation, and a repeat intensive PK profile was obtained.21","https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2010/10000/a_chewable_pediatric_fixed_dose_combination_tablet.11.aspx?casa_token=Fb6CPiJ1LrUAAAAA:waW6ZWrWbE-Z6gPgxpU6a21epxw6RtLUMtvLMSQVnEMFUAtTHog_RLvUme3Snk14fwLycG5Cdmtm4GhxnZufnyF2

Pharmacokinetic samples were collected before drug intake and then at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after drug intake.

Study design
An open comparative intervention study was conducted to determine the clinical efficacy and PK‐PD properties of lumefantrine in African SAM (n = 133) and non‐SAM children (n = 266). A subset of the whole study was chosen to be part of the PK study (n = 131 for SAM children and n = 160 for non‐SAM children). Details on the study protocol as well as the clinical efficacy and safety have been published previously.35, 36 This study was conducted at two hospitals, the Oulessebougou District Hospital, Koulikoro region, Mali, and at the primary healthcare center on Andoume, Maradi City, Niger. Two identical versions of the protocol were prepared, a French protocol that was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Odonto‐Stomatologie and the Faculty of Pharmacy in Bamako, Mali (number 2O13/93/CE/FMPOS) and Niger National Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health (number 004/2014/CCNE), and an English version, which was approved by the MSF Ethical Review Board. The study was registered at Clinicaltrial.gov (registration number: NCT01958905, registration date: October 7, 2013).

Data Description
We conducted a pooled modelling analysis of data from three phase I trials, in which GH was used as a comparator arm: two randomised studies of children with GHD (Trial 1, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01973244 [19] and Trial 2, NCT00936403 [20]), and one randomised study of subjects with adult GHD (Trial 3, NCT01706783) [21]. Details of the study designs and inclusion/exclusion criteria for these three trials have previously been published in full [19–21].

In brief, Trial 1 was a phase I, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, dose-escalation trial involving 32 prepubertal GH-treated children with GHD, in which Nordtropin® was used as an active comparator to somapacitan (a once-weekly GH in development) [19].

Trial 2 was a single-dose, dose-escalation trial designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NNC126-0083, a pegylated long-acting GH, in prepubertal children with GHD, with Norditropin® as the active comparator [20].

Trial 3 was a phase I, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation trial involving 34 GH-treated adult subjects with GHD, in which Nordtropin® was used as an active comparator to somapacitan [21].","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01973244

Study population
Data from 112 children were extracted from six clinical reports funded by UCB S.A. Pharma (Studies A to F) and used in the analysis. Male and female paediatric patients aged 0.5–12 years were included. 
Study design, dosing and blood sampling
Study A [5] was a double-blind, randomized, parallel (two groups), multiple dose, single-centre clinical trial in children aged 6–12 years, with a documented history of pollen-induced allergic rhinitis. Outpatients underwent a 1-week placebo treatment followed by a 5-week treatment period when they received one 5- or 10-mg cetirizine capsule daily during the season in which pollen levels were highest (July–October). Study B [6] was a double-blind, randomized, parallel (three groups), multiple dose, multicentre clinical trial in children aged 6–12 years who were suffering from perennial rhinitis. Cetirizine tablets were administered at a dose of either 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Study C [4] was an open label, single dose, single-centre study in children aged from 7 to 12 years, with a history of allergic rhinitis, to whom one 5-mg cetirizine capsule was administered orally. Study D [3] was an open label, single dose, single-centre study in children between 2.5 and 3.8 years of age hospitalized for a chronic respiratory infection or allergic condition. A single dose of 5 mg cetirizine as paediatric drops (10 mg ml−1) was administered. Study E [2] was an open label, single dose, single-centre study in children aged 2–6 years, who underwent a simple surgical intervention. A single dose of 5 mg cetirizine in the form of an oral solution (10 mg ml−1) was administered on an empty stomach as premedication for surgery, about 90 min before anaesthesia. Study F [4] was an open label, single dose, two-centre study in infants aged 0.5–2 years. A single oral dose of 0.25 mg kg−1 cetirizine was administered as a solution (10 mg ml−1). Frequent blood samples were collected over 24 h after dosing in studies D, E and F and over 72 h in Study C. In Study A, frequent blood samples were collected for 24 h after the first dose on day 1 of week 2 and single samples were also taken at each subsequent weekly visit, and in Study C a single blood sample was collected between 2 and 16 h following dosing in the second week. For Study B, a single blood sample was collected between 2 and 16 h following dosing on the second week of treatment. All studies were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, and all had approval from an ethics committee [2–6]. Parental consent was obtained for each child to participate in the studies.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0091674989903588

Extended pediatric models for children with HIV (and on EFV‐based regimen) and those without HIV
With the inclusion of children with HIV, specifically limited to those who are on an EFV‐based antiretroviral regimen, we extend the pediatric model to reflect that drug clearance differs between HIV uninfected and HIV infected children on EFV (model 2), as in the adult model. 30 A further extension with presence of effect of HIV infection and/or EFV administration on CL and F was also investigated (model 3). Because all children living with HIV who will be enrolled in IMPAACT 2005 will also be on EFV‐based regimen, data obtained from this design does not have the ability to tease out the effects HIV infection from the effect of EFV administration.

The pharmacokinetics of CQ in blood and HCQ in blood and plasma was evaluated using pharmacokinetic models previously published based on adult subjects [40,41,42,43]. To allow the characterisation of lung and plasma concentrations, a ratio of 5 was assumed for the correlation between whole blood-and-plasma levels of CQ [44]. For RDV, a pharmacokinetic model was developed based on the mean plasma concentration-time profile of the main nucleoside metabolite (GS-441524) in healthy rhesus macaques following intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg of RDV. Full details of the experimental protocol can be found in [23].","https://journals.lww.com/drug-monitoring/fulltext/2003/12000/Population_Pharmacokinetics_of_Hydroxychloroquine.5.aspx?casa_token=z2fsQNaLBMAAAAAA:HVE7hrg755o7KFVyPufLHvnRikAv94E_rPkZT047Qr2NBYZ-M-SRdufw3t94ARMXLXsBqrPwTehtv8WbdzVM5rHl

Paediatric data were obtained from two studies by the Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS (PENTA), in which abacavir was dosed firstly at 8 mg kg−1 twice daily and then at 16 mg kg−1 once daily. The studies were approved by the ethics committees of each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained from legal guardians, carers and children where appropriate. PENTA 13 was a two-period, crossover, open-label multicentre pharmacokinetic study. Fourteen children were included in the study [18]. PENTA 15 had the same design, but included 23 infants and toddlers (22 of them had PK data after twice daily dosing.) [19]. For both studies plasma samples for the analysis of abacavir concentrations were collected at steady-state conditions, with each patient contributing with four to nine blood samples. A summary of the demographic variables and treatment regimens for both PENTA trials is shown in Table 1.
Adult data were obtained from six clinical studies performed by GlaxoSmithKline [20–25]. One hundred and eleven adult subjects were retrieved from GlaxoSmithKline's clinical database and used as a reference population. Further details on these trials can be found at GSK clinical trial register (http://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com/).","18-19:

Patient data. Patient-level data from two separate studies were used for the analyses described herein. The study designs of these two studies have been previously described in detail, and, again, these are referred to as the “PPRU study” (9) and the “prophylaxis study” (5).
Briefly, the PPRU study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT00514358) combined data from two separate clinical studies. In both of these studies, dosing was performed per routine clinical practice, and no exclusion criteria were used. The first study included in the PPRU study was a multicenter (n = 8), open-label, PK study that enrolled premature and term infants and stratified enrollment on the basis of BGA (23 to 25 weeks, 26 to 29 weeks, 30 to 33 weeks, and ≥34 weeks) and PNA (<14 days and 14 to 119 days). The second study included in the PPRU study was an open-label PK study of antimicrobial drugs performed at a single institution (Duke University Hospital). 
The prophylaxis study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT00734539) leveraged PK data collected in an efficacy and safety study of fluconazole prophylaxis in extremely low birth weight premature infants. This study was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that included infants with a birth weight of ≤750 g.","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00514358

Patient Population and Data Collection
The final analyzed data originated from three clinical studies: the historical cohorts of van Bel et al. [28] and Benders et al. [29], with a pooled population PK analysis as described by van Kesteren et al. [26], and the PK substudy of the ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled ALBINO study [16]. All studies investigated the effect of allopurinol on survival and neurodevelopmental outcome in (near-)term neonates with perinatal asphyxia and early signs of evolving encephalopathy.
Establishing population PK/PD data of allopurinol and oxypurinol was a predefined secondary aim of the ALBINO study. This substudy was conducted in four specific centres (University Medical Centre Utrecht and Amsterdam UMC location VUMC in The Netherlands, and University Hospital Tuebingen and Cnopf Children’s Hospital Nuremberg in Germany) involved in the ALBINO study and was approved by all relevant national and institutional Medical Ethics Committees (NL57237.041.16; EudraCT 2016-000222-19). Further details of the study protocol are published and the trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03162653) [16].

Data were then further categorized into dose bands, as different dosing regimens had been used. The banding of the clinical data is detailed in Table 1. Data from one of the four dose bands in the 10–20-year-old patient age range were used for model building, as they were the least likely to be affected by age-related changes, while the remaining three dose bands were used for the model development set.

PK Data for PBPK Model Development and Pediatric Scaling
After a comprehensive literature search, eight PK studies in adults with 17 different treatment blocks after intravenous administration of buprenorphine were identified. Two of these studies were performed in an elderly population, one was a DDI study with rifampicin as the perpetrator drug. The dataset encompasses wide mean age and dose ranges with 21 to 67.5 years and 0.3 to 16 mg buprenorphine, respectively. In six treatment blocks, norbuprenorphine plasma concentrations were reported. All plasma concentration-time profiles were digitized and split into an internal training (n = 7 profiles) and an external test dataset (n = 16 profiles). The internal training dataset was complemented with information on the fraction of buprenorphine metabolized to norbuprenorphine, fraction of buprenorphine excreted unchanged in urine, and fraction of dose excreted in urine as norbuprenorphine [35,52,53]. For the evaluation of the PBPK model predictions in pediatrics, two clinical trials investigating buprenorphine plasma concentrations in both children (age: 4.6–7.5 years) and preterm neonates (27–34 weeks postmenstrual age) were located and the data digitized. An overview of the included clinical studies, comprising study characteristics and dosing regimens, is shown in Table 1.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/6/578#table_body_display_pharmaceutics-12-00578-t001,NA

A full PBPK model was first set up based on the reported plasma concentration–time profiles after intravenous administration in healthy volunteers (Rowell et al., 1983).
In a second stage of model evaluation, the plasma concentration– time profiles for orally administered dihydrocodeine recorded in three separate studies (Ammon et al., 1999; Fromm et al., 1995; Schmidt et al., 2003) were predicted using the developed PBPK model after single or multiple oral administrations (40 or 50 mg) to adult 100 (not shown) and 1000 virtual Caucasians whose phenotypes were P450 2D6 extensive (Figure 3a), intermediate (Figure 3b), or poor metabolizers (Figure 3c).

Development of dihydrocodeine PBPK model for Japanese children

Plasma concentration–time curves for virtual oral administrations of dihydrocodeine that matched those of three Japanese children who were administered dihydrocodeine in a clinical setting and two who took an overdose (Shimizu et al., 2018) were generated using the Simcyp pediatric system (Figure 4).","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01037958

2.4.1. Caffeine 
Some model refinements were performed to match the clinical plasma concentrations in healthy Nigerian adult volunteers (n = 10) after a 300-mg oral dose dissolved in water [24].The PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed using extracted plasma concentration data from malnourished Nigerian children (n = 7) with kwashiorkor with an average age of 2.6 years (range 1.3–4.5 years) [25].

2.4.2. Cefoxitin
The PBPK model was then optimized, by parameter identification, towards the clinical plasma concentrations reported in healthy volunteers after intravenous cefoxitin doses of 2 g (5-min infusion) or 30 mg/kg (3-min infusion) [26,27]. PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed using reported serum concentration data after a 40-mg/kg intravenous cefoxitin dose in malnourished South African children (n = 6) with kwashiorkor with average age 28 ± 12 months [28].

2.4.3. Ciprofloxacin
Some model refinements were performed to match the clinical plasma concentrations in healthy American adult volunteers (n = 14) after a 750-mg oral dose [30]. PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed using extracted plasma concentration data from Kenyan children (n = unknown) defined as malnourished by the following criteria: WHZ ≤ 3, MUAC < 11 cm, or the presence of bilateral pedal oedema (kwashiorkor) [31]. 

2.4.4. Lumefantrine
We characterized lumefantrine intestinal absorption using data reported by a food-effect study in Chinese healthy adult volunteers (n = 16) as well as previous assessments of fraction absorbed (fabs), reported to be 4.7% and 75% in fasted and fed state, respectively [33,34]. The PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed versus observations of lumefantrine in malnourished Malian and Nigerien children (n = 131), aged 6‒59 months, with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria [23].

2.4.5. Pyrimethamine
Model development was then performed, by parameter identification, towards: (a) clinical plasma and whole-blood concentrations reported in healthy volunteers (n = 7) after a 25-mg oral dose of pyrimethamine; and (b) whole-blood concentrations reported in malaria-infected adult volunteers (n = 228) after a 75-mg oral dose [37,38,39,40].
PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed using compiled observations of pyrimethamine in malnourished malaria-infected African children (n = 60) aged 16–60 months [38,39].

2.4.6. Sulfadoxine
Model development was then performed, by parameter identification, towards: (a) clinical plasma and whole-blood concentrations reported in healthy volunteers (n = 7) after a 500-mg oral dose of sulfadoxine; and (b) whole-blood concentrations in malaria-infected adult volunteers (n = 228) after a 1500-mg oral dose [37,38,39,40].PK evaluation of the PSP strategy was performed using compiled observations of sulfadoxine in malnourished African children (n = 59), aged 17–60 months, with P. falciparum malaria.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002280050734

2.1. Clinical Study Data
The results of two clinical studies were available for PBPK modeling. Study 1 (APG101_CD_001) was a Phase I first-in-human dose escalation and PK study in 20 healthy volunteers. Asunercept was administered as a single dose (SD) 1-h intravenous infusion, in doses of 0.008, 0.040, 0.200, 1.0, 5.0, 15.0, or 20.0 mg/kg [10]. Study 2 (APG101_CD_002) was a Phase II study in 84 patients with first or second progression of glioblastoma; 58 of these patients received asunercept with concomitant radiotherapy, the remaining patients were treated with radiotherapy only. Asunercept was administered as a weekly (QW) 0.5-h intravenous infusion, in a fixed dose of 400 mg [3]. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the studies APG101_CD_001 and APG101_CD_002. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol APG101_CD_001 was approved by the Ethics Committee Berlin (LaGeSo) (ZS EK 13 260/08; EudraCT no. 2008-000130-49); the protocol APG101_CD_002 was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty Heidelberg (AFmu-375/2009; EudraCT no. 2009-013421-42).

The results of two clinical studies were available for PBPK modeling. Study 1 (APG101_CD_001) was a Phase I first-in-human dose escalation and PK study in 20 healthy volunteers. Asunercept was administered as a single dose (SD) 1-h intravenous infusion, in doses of 0.008, 0.040, 0.200, 1.0, 5.0, 15.0, or 20.0 mg/kg [10]. Study 2 (APG101_CD_002) was a Phase II study in 84 patients with first or second progression of glioblastoma; 58 of these patients received asunercept with concomitant radiotherapy, the remaining patients were treated with radiotherapy only. Asunercept was administered as a weekly (QW) 0.5-h intravenous infusion, in a fixed dose of 400 mg [3].","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576912000707?casa_token=zXDsrE7yKKEAAAAA:O8RiLRNcclVIzcrBqcW3GPvcKkSTSOFZPOqdiSQU87BXG6J2qOZaW-UNGNIJsnRyb03PFD6lNR8

The clinical PK data used for the model building process (0.8 mg/kg from Study 12871) were first compared to model simulations. After refinement of the model with incorporation of a hypothetical binding partner, the PBPK base simulations were again compared to the datasets used for model development and independent (validation) datasets for copanlisib 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.2 mg/kg from Study 12871 as well as clinical PK data from the phase II study, Study 16349A. 23

PMID: 21827216.","Marmosets, Human Adult and Pediatric Populations",oseltamivir,influenza A and B infections,21827216,"Pharmacokinetic Data: Marmosets
The animal data used in this work were based on a single-dose study in adult and newborn marmosets. Aqueous solutions of oseltamivir were administered by oral gavage at nominal doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg and by slow intravenous bolus at 5 mg/kg. Four adults and four newborns 1–3 days old were used for each dose. Blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 8 hours post-dose (oral), and at 0.083, 0.25, 1, 5 and 8 hours post-dose (intravenous).

Plasma samples were assayed by a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method with a lower limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL for both oseltamivir and OC.

Plasma concentration-time profiles were analysed by using WinNonlin Professional version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For the reporting of pharmacokinetic parameters, the maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Cmax) was determined directly from the plasma concentration-time profiles, while the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated non-compartmentally, using the linear trapezoidal method. For the AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC∞), the apparent terminal elimination rate was obtained by log-linear regression of the terminal phase of the plasma concentration-time curve with extrapolation from the observed concentration at the last time point.

Pharmacokinetic Data: Humans
Pharmacokinetic data in adult humans were based on intravenous doses of OC 150 mg and oseltamivir 15 mg given over 1 hour in six healthy male subjects.[5] Oral data were obtained after a single dose of oseltamivir 100 mg in six healthy male subjects.[5]

For human infants and neonates, few data are available, although preliminary results are emerging from two ongoing trials.[25] CASG114 is a study where nominal doses of 3 mg/kg were given every 12 hours orally for 5 days to infants aged less than 2 years with confirmed influenza infection. CASG119 is a study in neonates (many of whom were preterm) of postnatal age 1.5–17.5 weeks who received 12-hourly oral doses of 1.7 mg/kg for 5 days. These babies had been exposed to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and were receiving oseltamivir prophylactically.[25]","Marmosets:

2.1.1. Adult Population with Normal Kidney Function The PK of 3TC, FTC, and GCV were simulated in adults with normal kidney function using the default North European white “Sim-Healthy volunteer” population. Predictions of PK were compared to observed PK data reported by Heald et al., Wang et al., and Czock et al. [29,30,31].
2.1.2. Adult Populations with Various Degrees of CKD We simulated the PK of the three compounds in adult populations with various degrees of CKD to confirm whether the PBPK model was able to adequately predict 3TC, FTC, and GCV exposure in these populations. Final virtual population characteristics, including adjusted parameters, are reported in the Supplementary Figure S1 and Tables S2–S6. Model performance was assessed by comparing predicted PK data with observed PK data of all compounds in different adult CKD populations (Supplementary Table S7) [17,20,29,30,31].
2.1.3. Paediatric Population with Normal Kidney Function 
Individual 3TC PK data were available from a paediatric clinical study by Burger et al. [32].
For FTC, clinical data were extracted from two paediatric studies [33,34].

The values for observed clearance of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and nonantibody proteins were obtained from the literature (S1-S57), and the predicted clearance values in pediatric patients (age range from preterm neonates to adolescents) were compared with the observed values for each therapeutic protein. In this study, there were 16 monoclonal antibodies, 9 polyclonal antibodies, and 10 nonantibody proteins.

Data for basiliximab, canakinumab, and gemtuzumab were extracted from the clearance vs weight or age plots provided by the authors (S1, S2, S5, S11), so that age could be stratified to a narrower range. The data extraction was done by digitizeit.21

For 2 polyclonal antibodies (Sandoglobulin [S35], and Gamimmune [S36]), the clearance values were calculated on the basis of the mean concentration-time data provided by the authors (S35, S36). This was done because it was noted that the clearance values of these 2 polyclonal antibodies were absolute values rather than body weight adjusted as reported by the authors. The recalculation of clearance of these 2 polyclonal antibodies indicated that indeed the clearance values were absolute values rather than body weight–adjusted values as reported by the authors.",https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fjcph.1846&file=jcph1846-sup-0001-SuppMat.doc,NA

Empty circles represent fraction absorbed estimated by deconvolution of the observed mean concentration data reported by Kumar et al,50 and the solid line represents the predicted dose fraction absorbed: (D) 1-5 years old, (E) 6-10 years old, (F) 11-16 years old.

Figure 4. Observed data were taken from Blumer et al,54who investigated the pharmacokinetics of a single dose administered orally as a liquid formulation in children aged 2-18 years of age: (A) 0.125 mg/kg; mean age, 9.6 years; (B) 0.25 mg/kg; mean age, 9.1 years; (C) 0.5 mg/kg; mean age, 10.0 years. (D-F) Dose fraction absorbed. Empty circles represent fraction absorbed estimated by deconvolution of the observed mean concentration data reported by Blumer et al,54 and the solid line represents the predicted dose fraction absorbed: (D) 0.125 mg/kg;mean age, 9.6 years; (E) 0.25 mg/kg; mean age, 9.1 years; (F) 0.5 mg/kg; mean age, 10.0 years.","https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918(12)00733-3/fulltext
